# todo-list
Welcome to Do-Too! This is another brilliantly-named app of mine, built along
my journey through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list). 

This is my first time building a project as big as this one. It certainly
was a challenge to try to manage all this code, while making sure it remained
readable (You will have to judge by yourself how well I did).

Sadly, for now, the page remains unresponsive - its built with desktop in mind.
I want to focus on making progress with the curriculum, as this project already
took me a lot of time.

App built using HTML, CSS, JS, webpack and date-fns. Check it out live
[here](https://petracore.github.io/todo-list/)

~ Because now you too... can do.

Maybe I should become a marketer instead, shouldn't I?  ;)
